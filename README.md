# Gross-Salary-Allocation
A project that explains a constructive breakdown of individual payrolls in a firm.
This is about an incentive based salary model, of a firm. This project explains the patterned allocation of payment to staffs on different grade levels.
Here with the use of VLOOKUP fuction on excel, I was able to denote the specific payment for different work allowances.
( BASIC, HOUSING, TRANSPORT, LEAVE, MEAL, UTILITY, and finally the TOTAL GROSS PAY)
The purpose of this analysis is to enlighten the staffs, and show proper transparency to how much they are being paid monthly.
